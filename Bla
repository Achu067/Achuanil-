Abstract:

The Automatic Pronunciation Mistake Detector (APMD) is a system designed to identify and correct pronunciation errors in spoken language. Leveraging advanced speech recognition and natural language processing technologies, the system analyzes audio input to detect deviations from standard pronunciation patterns. By utilizing machine learning models trained on large speech datasets, the APMD can differentiate between correct and incorrect pronunciations, providing real-time feedback to users. This tool is particularly beneficial for language learners, speech therapists, and educators, offering an effective way to monitor and improve pronunciation accuracy. The system is capable of evaluating phonetic accuracy, stress patterns, intonation, and rhythm, helping users enhance their speaking skills and achieve more native-like pronunciation.
